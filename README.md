# About
 This is my Emacs configuration file(s) to implement a *self-use* cross-platform editor/IDE. It has been tested for Emacs 27.2/28.0.05 (with native-compilation feature) on MacOS (Big Sur), Linux (Ubuntu 20). Windows may not be well supported because of possible limitations from cygwin/MSYS2. WSL2 is recommended instead.

# Quick-start

Install Emacs and download the init files in your `$HOME` directory:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Leslieying/.emacs.d.git
```
Then have some beverage and wait for downloading :smile:
